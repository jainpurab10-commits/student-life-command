            <h1>About Student Life Command Center</h1>
            <p>
                I built this website as my first complete web development project using only HTML and CSS.
                The idea was simple: make one place where I can organise my college life properly.
            </p>

            <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
            <p class="section-note">
                Most of the time, my timetable, assignments, fees, notes and exam dates were all
                scattered in chats, photos and rough pages. I wanted something cleaner.
            </p>
            <p>
                So instead of making a basic portfolio or a random demo site, I decided to build
                a small “control center” for student life – something I can actually use every day.

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Timetable screenshots get lost, assignments are announced in class and forgotten,
                    attendance is only checked at the end, and money just disappears without any record.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="about-card">
                <h3>The Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    Put everything in one website: timetable, assignment planner, attendance tracker,
                    expense planner and a page for links and notes. Keep it simple, clean and printable.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="about-card">
                <h3>Who It’s For</h3>
                <p>
                    Any student can use this format. You just change the subject names, dates and links,
                    and it works for any course or semester.
